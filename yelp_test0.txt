It only tasted okay when I dipped it in a sauce. I didn't even wanna eat it after I got a box for it and brought it with me back to my hotel.   The next day, I went back again before the end of my trip. I ordered the chili since I was starting to feel sick from the whole weekend. After eating half of the bowl, I couldn't finish it because it was so spicy. It was very good though, since it had filet mignon chunks in it. But the spice was just too overwhelming.   Next time, I'll just have the frozen hot chocolate and that's it. I'm done giving their food more chances, only to be let down on more than one occasion.
279	0	First time trying this place. The things I liked are the sides bar (pasta, salad, mashed potatoes). I didn't like that we were charged for fancy "bottled" water that we didn't know about until the bill came and noticed the bottle was already opened and my cousin said it tasted like tap water. So since we paid for it we asked could we take the bottle and we were told "sure for $12" we passed.   Then we were told there was 12 different selections of meat we counted about 8 and really only had about 3 (ham, tri tip, ny steak) ham was the best to be honest. We didn't like rare or medium rare so we waited quite a long time to get ours well done. So after waiting for awhile we just called it quits. I don't think it's worth the price luckily we had a buy one get one free but still seemed too pricey for what you get. Safe to say my first and last visit.

LUCY, who I believe might be the manager (hostess) kept telling us different things. We were a party of 12. One minute we have a Table and next minute, We DON'T..!! Our Tables were taken by a Seven Stars or Diamond Card Holder..  THE FOOD WAS NOT WORTH IT..!!!!! The Wait or the Lies Left a Bad Taste in My Mouth..!!  I Don't Think I Will Be Coming Back... :(
545	1	This place is hidden behind the clear/silver elevator across from STK.  It's not on any maps & it's down a hallway.  They had the best think crust pizza.  If you don't like pizza sauce they have a "white" slice and it has no tomato sauce.  Just cheese & garlic.  It's only $3.50 for a slice, however the soda in a red cup is the SAME price.  I thought that was a bit  much.  As soon as you come up the escalator stay straight ahead and you'll see it .
109	0	Upon exiting, I look for the Riviera Casino and Hotel. It appears that our GPS is guiding us to the slums. Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.  Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....  I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job.   I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.  I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!  Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.  You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night.   At the cashier, I was asked "where did you win all this money"? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.  I will never stay here again, but  I would play at their casino floor, hoping for another good bonus flop!
604	1	Came here for brunch this past Saturday.  My cranky pants best friend was getting really cranky cause the coffee took a bit long to get to us and the food took even longer.  Anyways, places like this likes to deliver entrees to everyone at the same time and we had a party of 11.  I got the croquette madame and he got the chicken and waffles.  My entree was delicious and their fries were perfection.  His chicken was mediocre but the waffles and maple syrup was delicious! We also got a side order of the sausage and apple wood bacon.  Both were so good.  Together the both of us, it was $70.  Not too bad. Definitely want to return to try their dinner menu.
1591	0	The Food here is not any better than the other Buffets in Vegas. But they run a ridiculous system here. They close down the buffet between meals.   On the day of my visit, We where outside lining up to get in. I saw no signs that they close between meals. No staff to attend to customers. Only an enclosure placed in front of the escalator.  We where the first few people in front of the line for we arrived 9 45 am. By 10:30 a cashier came up taking customers. So we paid for the meal hoping we going to have lunch soon.  To my surprice another line was being formed downstairs. No one was seating the customers. So we had to wait another 30 min to get to our tables.   This is truly stupid coz lunch is more expensive than breakfast. There is no point of making people wait if they have paid for lunch during breakfast hour.  I asked the server why such a system. She told me that employees takes there break during these times. In other words, the buffet is understaff.  I tell you the food is no better than any great Vegas buffet. Go somewhere else. Its not worth the wait.
779	0	Clean and sterile like an operating room.....  Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced "Imported from France" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.
968	0	They really need to re-evaluate on having a buffet.   With so much history, at the MGM Grand and this is what they have to offer. It's rather disappointing and I would say the worst buffet in Vegas I've had in the 10 years I've been coming to Vegas. Either they don't listen to the reviews or they just don't care. To me it's ruining MGM's image and unacceptable.  The food quality is below par with the exception of the desserts which is slightly better. Everthing was either overcooked, or dry. The atmosphere reminds me one of those $11.99 Chinese buffet. Never again.
539	0	Not a fine dining of course, it's more of a causal grab a bit kind of place. The Singaporean noodle was good. Spring rolls were average. I expected a bit more from the place in terms of food quality in lieu of it being in Bellagio. PS mango pudding was okay too!
167	0	The air filtration system in the rooms are in poor condition. On two occasions of my stay here at the hotel, both times my room smelled like wet mops and mildew. I awoke coughing after an uncomfortable rest in a room that's scent choked my lungs.  The lobby staff IS friendly and aside of that, the rooms are , at most, barely tolerable.
84	1	I'm keeping this review short since there are so many to review from.  Service - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Price - 4 stars (a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so to speak)  We were recently in Vegas celebrating my boy's bachelor party.  We came in with a party of 10 and were instantly greeted and seated.  They gave us some pistachios and bread to start with.  Try the bread with a little butter and their home made mustard.  The combo sounds kinda weird, but it's killer!  To warm the taste buds, I ordered the cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty but nothing extraordinarily different.  However, for my main course, I ordered the sirloin steak sous vide with vegetables.  Mid order, I asked the waiter if I could swap the veggiies for fries.  He said, the order comes with the veggies but that he'd bring 3 baskets of fries for our group on the house.  And as for the steak, it was vacuumed sealed to capture the juices....and it definitely tasted that way.  Juiciest Sirloin ever!  Cooked to perfection and was super tasty.
573	1	Jeremy was our server and Scott had no problem jumping in to help. Theses two guys were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was perfect for my 9 years old. We've been here quite a few times, but the service this time was definitely something to yelp about. We will continue to return to this restaurant.
1780	1	- The Skinny:  Food Quality: 5 Stars -  Great pizza! Get the Meatball, Pepperoni, or their most popular slice, "The White".    Meatball - Large slices of Meatball and globs of ricotta cheese.  Pepperoni - Large slices of real pepperoni, makes pizza chains seem like they are using intimidation pepperoni?     "The White" - its all cheese, fresh ricotta, and garlic sauce. There is no pizza sauce on that one but trust me, its good! My wife loves Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and dislikes NY style, but this was the best pizza she ever had.   Pricing: 5 Stars - $5 a slice, if you're hungry, get 2 slices as they are large, but thin (NY style). It costs more than other pizza joints but factor in that it's located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.   Service: 3 Stars - Nothing incredible but it is just a pizza counter and they are just mashing out pizzas. The workers were friendly and helped me choose some good slices. There is a little bit of a wait but its worth it!  Atmosphere: 5 Stars - Has a real NY pizza place feel. A couple pinball machines and some TV's playing sports. Hallway is decorated with vintage vinyl records and adds some class but once its opens up to the pizza counter, its straight NY style!   Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the "game lounge" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats).   Comfort: 3 Stars - It's a narrow hallway any little counter space to eat, but you will be there just to buy and run so no worries there.   Location: 3 Stars trying to find it but as far as theme goes (being a secret, 5 Stars) - Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the "game lounge" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). With a name like "Secret Pizza", mission accomplished!   - The Fat:   My in-laws were in town and of course we needed to take them out to the Vegas Strip. There was 25 of us so no need for a sit down dinner, especially with many small children. I found "Secret Pizza" on Yelp and opt'ed to go there as we made our way to the Bellagio fountain show.   It was tricky to find, had to use my GPS and ask 3 hotel employees to get there but it really is a hidden treat. You will have to wait a little bit, I was there on a Sat night around 11pm and we waited about 20-30 mins?  The pizza is delicious! hot, fresh, and kills any other pizza I had, only rivaled by Grimaldi's Pizza in NY under the Brooklyn bridge. I would go out of my way to go here again. If you are on the strip and want fast, inexpensive, but quality food, go to Secret Pizza!!!
1930	0	Gone downhill recently. No 'fish' at the fishmonger - only cheap crab. Pasta chef never knew what basic dishes were and the selection all round was on the lower end of the scale.  I guess the Mirage hotel is trying to appeal to the budget customer and sets product choice to match.
112	1	Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeo poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese
830	0	The name says it all. THIS should be your last resort.  We walked by this restaurant many times before deciding to go, it looked like a load of fun, the food was okay, not the greatest.   The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time.   Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill.   The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?  So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have
979	0	My husband and I decided to play "tourist" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says "Doesn't this taste a little funny?"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.  PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the "deer in the headlights" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!
359	1	I seriously dream about this pizza.   On my last few trips to Vegas, Secret Pizza has been one of my first stops every time. One slice is never enough (even though they are HUGE.)  As a pizza connoisseur, I vote that this is the best of the best. You will not be disappointed I promise. And if you are, then we can't be friends.
1207	0	I remember MGM Grand as one of the best hotel/casinos on the strip, and now it's just, ugh, or eh.  Their buffet is horrific and their casino had this horrible vanilla smell mixed with like tobacco, just wasn't a good look.  I won't even mention the crowds just because I understand, it's Vegas in the middle of the afternoon, whatever.  My husband and I literally waited for our car at valet for as long as we spent eating at their buffet, but the valet attendant was very sweet, so 1 star for him. I just don't know what happened to this place.
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
229	0	It sounds like a lot of people like the French Onion soup. Well, on the contrary, my cousin wasn't satisfied with his French Onion Soup at all. He took about 3 sips and gave up on it. I don't know if he's just picky, it was a bad day for french onion soup, or it's really just not that great.   I ordered the turkey pot pie. POT PIE? I love pot pies. I think it was the special of the day, so I gave it no second thought and ordered it. The first thing I thought to myself upon seeing my pot pie was, "UMMMMM, is this the right order? This looks like a croissant wannabe over a well of pea and turkey soup." Okay, I might be describing it worse than it actually is. Check out the picture I posted and judge for yourself. The presentation was nice, but wasn't at all how I imagined it. I dug into the puff pastry hoping to find lobster, but it was just more...puff pastry. =[ Boy was I bummmmmmmed. If only all the peas and turkey bits were INSIDE of the puff pastry..it didn't even taste that great, hence the 2 stars.   I won't come back unless I'm really hungry at night and everything else is closed-why? It's open 24/7.
1178	1	Unbelievably, Incredibly Good  I'll spare you a lengthy read.  I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.  We flew from San Francisco to Las Vegas to have lunch here.  AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!  We will do it again.  It was our second meal there - every bit as good as the first.  The location is not great, but the food is utterly amazing.  EAT HERE.
1839	1	Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention "Peppermill". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!
1420	0	Came here with a 2-4-1 MyVegas coupon for brunch so the price was great, but the food was okay and service was spotty at best.   Large assortment for brunch, especially for dessert. The sushi before 10am freaked me out so I steered clear. Nothing was all that memorable from this meal except for the poor service (I had to get up and ask the waiters standing around chatting to get a refill on drinks).
1550	1	You won't be disappointed!!!  It was simply great!!'  A bit of a wait but totally worth it   The Shack Stack is super good along with the smoke shack  The prices were about $6 a single and $9-10 for a double / shack stack.  Big seating area  Lives up to its hype!
1330	1	A consistently excellent dining experience.  Though Thomas Keller has probably not set foot in the place for years, his aura clearly remains in the service and attention to detail.  Little things like the bread and butter are excellent, but Keller goes one step further throwing in a handful of still-warm house-roasted pistachios.    I played it safe this time, having my favorites-- oysters to start and the steak frites entree.  Both were excellent as usual.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well.  The only negative s something they have no control over-- the customers-- decked out in flip-flops, way-too-short-shorts, or obnoxiously loud shirts.  Ahhh Vegas.  P.S.  The breakfast and brunch rock as well.
997	1	Pro: Cheesecake factory done right, TONS of seats, great food, excellent breakfast buffet. 24 hours!!!  Con: Back of the Venetian, can still be crowded during major conventions.  This is it, skip all your buffets and $150 dollar per person meals, come here and dine. The menu is long and detailed, from small to epic portions, everything is done right from 6 am to 9 pm. I have personally ate here 3 times while in those ungodly hours and everything is just done to perfection.   The breakfast buffet is a quick service option, most time is when my crew are here for CES, skip the wait, and go get your own food. The fruit is always the highlight, it's just better than the $33 dollars Caeser/Aria buffet.   If the place is packed, go eat at the bar, the service there is sometimes better.
972	1	I went here with high hopes and was not in the slightest bit disappointed. The waitstaff was very helpful and polite. Our waiter brought by a cart of meat to show us the cuts and explained them to us. We were started with a variety of breads served with smoked salt butter. They were terrific. I ordered the filet and it was great. I've been to other steakhouses and this was to die for. Had haricot vert on the side. It was tempura fried but a little greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't terrible. Also had the creamed spinach on the side which was pretty good. I almost died and went to heaven when I was served dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it was the best thing I've EVER eaten. I would go back a million times just to eat this dessert!!! I left here stuffed full but wanting to eat more! Will definitely go back in the future.
1610	0	This place is absolutely horrible. If asked o honestly couldn't think of a worse experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I usually don't write reviews because I generally feel like each persons experience is always different. Sometimes it can be the waiter or just a bad thing you ordered and some people want to give the place one star for it. Well this isn't that. This place is genuinely the worst restaurant I've ever been in. And I've been to A LOT. It was my wife and I's 5th year anniversary and we picked this place out of any other in Vegas because it sounded fun and like it had a huge variety. We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it'd be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner. The mashed potatoes had the viscosity of water with a little bit of sand in it. HORRIBLE. We tell them our displeasure with our experience and are told "were sorry you feel that way", the end. I would never suggest this place to anyone in my life and I hope this place goes under and everyone that works there can never find a job in the food service industry again.
1683	0	Zero stars, ya digggg. 1 star because i had to. This place is the shitter hole. I tried 2 other LV Buffets, and take my advice: GO STRAIGHT TO the Wicked Spoon Buffet at The Cosmopolitan. Best gosh darn food, ginormous selections, and great service. All the sites say it's the best, and hands down, it is.   Mandalay Bayside Buffet had the worst crap to eat + shittt service. So bad that we asked to talk to the manager, and she didnt do anything about our experience. NO one cleared our tables the whole hour we were there. When we walked personally to get the managers attention, she was snooty towards us. SAYONARA MAH DUDES won't be giving you a 2nd chance because of your uncaring restaurant presence. So many other choices, you should be on top of your game.   Waste of my hard earned Vegas money.
1700	1	Went here about a month ago.. Atmosphere Is like you're living on the set of the golden girls which I absolutely love! The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while.  The only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!
805	1	The wife and I came here for lunch and we were very impressed! The restaurant had a hip, stylish vibe with the fire decor in the front. Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalapeo burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating??? Other than the drunken stupidity, I loved every bit of it and definitely recommend going!
537	0	Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a "Meh, not so good." I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy.
114	0	When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally..."empty".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?
686	1	We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian.
1759	1	All I can say about this place is HUGE portions that can be shared with a lot of people. Gotta try their famous Andy's sage waffle and chicken. That sucker is huge and inside the waffle, it has bits of bacon. Yes, I said bacon. Bacon lovers get the chicken and waffle!  Every time I go here I always get good service and nothing bad seems to happen. They have set hours for breakfast/lunch and dinner. They close for about 2 and a half hours to get their dinner situated.   Very good place to eat your heart out. Go there hungry.
288	0	Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...
1138	1	Ugh this place is so good. I'm somewhat glad this place is 4+ hours away since I would just get fat going here.  Service Super attentive ! Water was always filled and I didn't have to raise my hand for too long if I needed something. Bae and I came here without a reservation on a Saturday (they only serve dinner at 5:30pm on weekends) and sat in a line for maybe 8min at most.  Food - garlic prawns.  What is there to say ? Incredibly flavorful, buttery and garlicky and I don't even know what else I'm eating but I just know my tongue is super happy. Bae and I got maybe 8 prawns and we still had leftovers - boat noodle soup (combination beef noodle soup/#109) Holy this is prolly my fav thing here other than the prawns. So incredibly flavorful and it almost makes me cry from whatever flavors my tongue is experiencing. Kicks my hometown Thai place's boat noodle soup out of the water. Honestly this doesn't even need the vermicelli noodles. If you get this with the beef and the bean sprouts, in combination with the amazing broth, you won't even miss the noodles. Get this. - khao soi Egg noodles in a light curry sauce with beef topped with crispy egg noodles. This was a tad hair shorter in the flavor department compared to the boat noodle soup, but with a squeeze of lime, it elevated the flavor tenfold. Pretty good, kind of a small portion. - nam kao tod (crispy fried rice) If you're looking for a flavor explosion with a bit of a crunch, I'd recommend this. Filled with crispy rice (how do they do it...), peanuts, a healthy dose of lime, sour pork sausage, red onions, I'm sure fish sauce, peanuts and other stuff, this is a party in your mouth. Compared to Vientiane (garden grove), this place stands it's ground for crispy rice. Bae kept looking up and pondering how this made his tastebuds flip. - mango sticky rice I love sticky rice and bae has never had mango sticky rice, so this was perfect. The rice seemed a little hard (chewier) than other ones I had, but it also had a fragrant jasmine taste to it. The mangoes were the small ones and it was an ample amount. Sweet and yummy, bae ate the whole thing.
1545	1	We came here Friday night, i was expecting they would be really busy, but when we got there, it was just enough people, not too busy but not slow.. We got sat right away, we got the gangnam set and it was so much food, it says its for party of 2, but i think it's a lot of food just for two people unless you're a big eater.. Lol..service was really good too, and overall experience it was good..:-) we'll be back for sure..
39	0	Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!
1199	1	Oh, wow.  Where to start?  This is a Las Vegas institution.  When I was a dealer at the old Sahara, we used to go here after work at 3:00 AM for an omelet and champagne.  The fireside lounge is kitchy, old-school Vegas, but the bar staff are great and the mixologists build great drinks.  Oh, and did I mention the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and there's a lot of it?  If you're on the strip and need a good meal at a good price, or you want to sit back and relax in a nice lounge and enjoy a beverage, this is THE place to go.
1284	1	This is the best Korean restaurant I've ever been!!!!!!!! The side dishes are great; the appetizers are awesome; the BBQ meat is so fresh and juicy.   We ordered steamed egg, chicken karage, and tuna kimbap for starters. Omgosh, they were all a fantastic. We ordered scallops, Korean prime kalbi, sweet corn, and enoki with bacon. I have never had such great kalbi before. The meat is so juicy and palatable, and I ate the meat with the sesame veggies in the house... it's like a taste of heaven.   Recommend recommend recommend!!!!
1008	1	Everyone is sooooo nice here. The customer service is great and of course the food is amazing. Not only will I be coming back as much as possible I will recommend it to my friends. I'm not a huge beef person but I got the lonely bird which was recommended to me and it is more than delicious. Milkshake infused alcohol is amazing as well. Everything is just so perfect about this place.
61	0	Went for breakfast and waited forever at the front for the rude hostess to even look at us.  Some bitchy granny seated is and lectured us about the dos and don'ts of eating breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was $16.00.  Because everything was not to my liking, I basically left there hungry.  The bacon was like chewing on plastic with artificial bacon flavoring.  The eggs were...(I have no words for them).  The only edible things were the fruits as they did not require cooking.  It was THE MOST DISGUSTING BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD and so not worth $16. I had breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay the previous day and it was awesome.   Do not eat here unless you have no other option. Between the disgusting food and the unfriendly staff, I can not understand why this dump exists in the basement of the hotels, which smells like a backed up sewer, by the way.
348	1	I wished this place existed when I attended UNLV. This place carries a lot of value with the amount of different (yet satisfying) portions/packages that even a poor college student can afford.  My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.  You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch.   The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55. A lot less from what I was expected to pay (hey I'm not complaining) but regardless of it being a mistake or not, I'll happily return.
274	0	MEH.  I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.  I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.  That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed.   So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
70	0	The customer service was very nasty!! I will never go here again and will pass the word on to friends and family!! I never would have expected to watch some as whole throw my food into the bag because the cashier as whole didn't confirm that it was and order to GO!  Got into a verbal confutation with the lady who threw my food in the bag!!.. Since I didn't have bail$$ I let her keep her teeth...  A little encouragement to the as whole lady please find yourself another job if you're unhappy with the Hot Dogs business!! The Original Pinks is in Los Angeles Ca. a much better place to go and eat a hot dog and know the customer service there has better class.
857	0	Please don't ever come here! If you love your family do not eat at this place. First things first walking in is the horrible smell. It smells like the inside of a nursing home. No lie. Secondly they do not have a person coming around taking your dirty plates, they will sit on your table for a while in the way of your food. Third it's in the ghetto which would be okay if they had good food and customer service which they do not. Inside gives you the feel that a fight can break out and end up on world star and any moment. And last but not least when we were finished eating sitting and talking about how we will never come here again we see one of the workers cleaning the Buffett area and putting all the food that drops around the sides BACK IN WITH THE OTHER FOOD. I am so traumatized
1736	1	Come here with an empty stomach and an appetite or be prepared to take some food home. The portions are huge! The breakfast menu is one of the most diverse that I've ever encountered. 4-egg omelettes and scrambles seem to be the rule in Las Vegas. The Egg & I omelettes were delicious and loaded with cheese. We had a veggie omelette and a veggie scramble. The potatoes were seasoned just right. Reading prior Yelp reviews beforehand, I doubted that the banana nut muffins could live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. Excellent. Fluffy and not too heavy on the banana. Prepare for a large crowd and a wait on the weekend. The hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. The bus staff too. And our server, Tamara, was a delight.
1065	1	Holy crap where do I start??? Tldr: if you're reading this, just go there as soon as you can.   We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was.   The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about.   And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me.   Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect.   Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right.   When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly.   The staff was always nice and sweet.   This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.   Will definitely come back, just for those muffins awww man.
1746	1	We had dinner here at midnight. At that hour, you kind of expect mediocre service and food to kind of just get you by. This was one of the best burgers I've had. I had a turkey burger and it was perfection. At first the fact that it was topped with blueberry compote sounded odd, but it worked so so well. Our truffle fries were fresh and fantastic, and my friends blue cheese burger was great.  A little pricey for a burger from the outset, but keep in mind it goes with Vegas prices, and you're eating GR creations.  Would definitely recommended for any occasion!
1293	0	Booked hotel room through Orbitz and received Complimentary Breakfast/Brunch.    Noticed the low star ratings but since it was Free Breakfast/Brunch, Sure, why not!  The food here is Bleh...    Prices for breakfast and brunch ranges from $17.25-$25.99...NOT WORTH IT!  Trust me, Go elsewhere!    Most of the items were cold, hard and dry...Yuck!  The worst is the eggs benedict, OMG Disgusting!  If you must eat here, stick with the strawberries n creme, chips w/ taco meat, bacon, string beans and asparagus...  ******************* Apparently, MGM Grand charged us for the Breakfast/Brunch buffets.  When we checked in, the front desk clerk told us it was included with the room.  We are currently in the process of disputing the charges. They have yet to return our calls or emails...  ******************** Update: After weeks of phone calls and emails, MGM finally credited us back the excessive charges (7/11/13).  It shouldn't have taken this long...
498	0	This place is way overrated! There was a long line to get in and once our group got in we noticed that the club was not even full. I included some of the many reasons to avoid this god forsaken place.  Reason #1 :  As a female I did not have to pay to get in but my male friends had to pay 30 bucks! Now looking back I wouldn't pay 5 cents to get in!  Reason #2: After about an hour the club started getting full to the point we couldn't move and the stupid bouncers kept telling us to move because we were blocking the way! We couldn't move because there were way too many people everywhere.  Reason #3: The DJ sucked..playing little snips of top 40 hits..lame. Reason #4: Unless you reserve a table do not even plan to sit down and rest or have a drink because there is absolutely no where to sit. Reason #5: Our group got separated and my sister was given a date rape drug here..when she finally found a bouncer to help her he picked her up, carried her to the side of the strip and left her.   She couldn't get up and walk due to the drug she was given.  DO NOT GO HERE..There are  many other nightclubs and lounges in Vegas that are excellent and fun! Don't waste your time.
500	0	I have several bones to pick with this place.  1) The cashier really talked up the fact that you get free beer and wine with dinner.  Yeah, there are TWO wine choices and just ONE beer. 2) When I did get my beer (which happened to be a Bud Light), the guy at the drink station said that he didn't have limes but that I should ask my server.  I asked my server and the entire buffet did not stock limes.  WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE LIMES??? 3) There was a Mexican food station and I got some taquitos (which ended up being crunchy but bland).  I ask the chef behind the neighboring station if they had sour cream or guacamole.  He looked at me as if I had asked him the meaning of life.  He had to call 2 other chefs over to confirm that no, they did not have guacamole (bummer!) and that the sour cream was likely in the salad bar. 4) I asked the lady at the dessert station if she could point me toward some desserts without nuts.  The only ones she pointed to were the sugar free ones.  At the time she was plating some type of chocolate cake and she held one piece of to her face and said "This one probably doesn't have nuts either."  And then she went about her business.  I am so sick of people not finding out for sure or just brushing off the question. I don't ask for fun...I ask because I will literally stop breathing and die if I eat nuts.  They did have some killer garlic mashed potatoes, so it's got that going for it.  Honestly, I love food and I am not that picky, but this place was just not good at all.  Just don't go here.
1449	1	My boyfriend and i love Gordon ramsey and all of his UK cooking shows, especially F word.  We were thrilled to be staying in Vegas at Paris where the new Gordon ramsey steak just opened. We shared the Caesar salad to start and Brian had the Strawberry martini. Best Caesar, great martini. Next we both had the Beef Wellington. Gamechanger! If you are in Vegas, stop reading this review and go to Gordon. The food is worth the price, and the waitstaff was fantastic as well. Olga from Siberia was a great waitress, I love a server with that right blend of spunk and professionalism, we had lots of fun! Overall, amazing experience and i will be dreaming about eating here again!  I can't say enough good things about Gordon, Yum!
1383	0	Used to go there often not so much since Shawn Eiferman isn't there playing music anymore. Food is ok, there used to be such a fun vibe that all the visitors would get into the action but now they have a guy from the Voice there and he is just kind of an arrogant guy and the drummer is a jerk.  Too bad they let Shawn go he was the showman, we follow him around Vegas and have for years and take our friends to hear him too. He is an entertainer that fills the house.
1844	1	I am traveling to Vegas for a convention. I also have Celiacs so I was afraid to eat anywhere for fear of being "Glutened". I was lucky to find this restaurant my first day here so I came back everyday for lunch. I am happy to say that the food was not only Delicious, but healthy for my food restrictions. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is casual but fun and clean. I highly recommend!
55	1	Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.  I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution.   The Ramsay brand did not let down!  P.S. Beef Wellington FTW
1123	0	Okay, first of all. If you are going to charge that much money, you better try a little bit harder to make the food taste good. Almost $20 per person!!! They take advantage of the fact that they are on the strip and just charge extra for it. Maybe if they made better food it wouldn't be much a big deal for $20. The food was so bad that we were still hungry after we left because we couldn't finish it. Save yourselves the trouble (and money) and go somewhere else.
407	0	Let me start by saying that I did not have to pay for food at this buffet.  My hotel package included daily access, so this will give you some further perspective into my review.  Food: I found the food to be monotonous and bland.   The exception is the Prime Rib and the fresh crab legs.  Everything else was below average.  I did not pay for the food, and I was STILL disappointed.  With taxes included, dinner for two would run you about $55.  The food is definitely not worth the price.  Service: I found the service to be mediocre as well.  They line you by party size in one of 5 lines.  From far off, it is reminiscent of a cattle-line.  Apart from this, all the other patrons are hungry as hell and rude; due in part to the size of the lines and long wait times.  Cursing, cutting, and bumping seemed to be commonplace here.  I have received better service (and food) at Golden Corral.  In short, this place had no class at all.  You will certainly leave with the B-G's (Bubble Guts).
950	0	Food barn.  There is no ambiance to look at. Just carpeted floor, barely smiling hosts and mediocre food.  I don't think it's worth it even with the discount coupons. I would like to give this a higher rating but there is really nothing that stands out fromt heir offerings.  Cotton Candy and their Middle Eastern section is the only saving grace from another deduction.  Some say that there is quality. They may be eating from the floor then.   Sorry.
750	1	There was a short wait when we came on a Saturday around 2pm. It was only 10-15mins so it was not too bad. I wanted to order from the lunch menu but they don't have that option for weekends. However, they have the happy hour menu from 3-6pm, look good but I already over ordered from the regular menu. Onto the food, we got harami miso, Korean prime Kali, spicy tuna kimbap, fried calamari, bibimbap, and spicy tofu soup. Imo, everything was good, except the tofu soup. The meat cut was high quality, so tender and well seasoned. The appetizers are fried perfectly. Bibimbap was good, but at $12.99, i think I rather get another meat dish instead. The soup was just so so, not memorable.  The service was okay, no smile when greetings, but otherwise attentive. I would definitely visit again, with a reservation, since I don't like to wait an hour wait for any food.
1528	0	Can't think of much good to say about this place.  Don't go for food, and not sure I would recommend the bar either.  There was a smell of rancid trash that would waft out of the kitchen occasionally and the service was poor.    Unless you are a teenager or a college student that just wants to get drunk, avoid this place like the plague.
1828	1	First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :)  Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing.   You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks.   Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices...   Just go here, that is all.
73	0	Was excited to come to the Riv again since they announced t was being demolished.  Had such great memories here as a kid.  But WOW was it BAD!!  The only thing that was god was the parking.  Both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf.  For 3 breakfast items it was over $50 with a tip and it was HORRIBLE!!!  Very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out.  Stay away and go somewhere else.
1536	1	Five stars for serving breakfast 24/7.   Surprisingly hard to find a breakfast joint after 11 in Vegas of all places and Grand Lux was just what the doctor ordered. Our server, despite this being a pretty casual restaurant, was so good at his job, was fun, upbeat, and all the bells and whistles.   Aside from my husband's home cooked steak and jalapeo breakfast burritos, I think I had my second best breakfast ever. And my god, do they give you so much food! They gave me six sausage links in my standard breakfast, for example.  If you're waking up at 2 pm and looking for breakfast, head straight to Grand Lux. It was a wonderful surprise.
822	0	Not worth the price after having been to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel & Casino.  This buffet was (key word, "was") rated the #1 buffet in Vegas but since the rating, there have been a whole group of buffets that have outdone this place.  This restaurant is mediocre at best.  Also, service is very spotty.  Once you go Carnival World Buffet, you don't go back!
188	0	the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/
1500	1	I went here for my last meal in Las Vegas and I was impressed! I had the Big Breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, enormous container pilled high of  frites (fries), brioche toast, 2 sausage links, tons of bacon, orange juice and  coffee or tea. It was more food than I could ever imagine!   The best part was the strawberry croissant that came first before the breakfast.  I have never had this good of croissant besides Paris.  It came split in half with the strawberries baked inside topped with cinnamon and  a studel like topping almost like a coffee cake!  I believe they baked it like that split in half!  It was AMAZING!!!! I had died and gone to heaven! It was so flakey and good! I could only eat half and based around for others to enjoy.  I did the same with the huge helping of bacon and massive container filled with fries!  Everything tasted perfect and was the best breakfast I had in a long time.  This meal was not cheap at $21.95 but was worth it! Service was pretty quick overall and decor was really nice and decorated cute.    If was a fab last meal for Vegas and we took off for the airport.
1687	1	This location is really convenient if you're done with class and want to settle for some good food and cheap beers. This is also located near the Kiss mini putt putt if you're trying to take someone on a cheap date.   I definitely receive my money's worth here, especially for it being a non AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant. The service is fast and friendly. The food is consistently delicious and you really can't beat the happy hour deals. I actually spent less money here for two people than if we were to go to any other AYCE. The pork belly and bulgolgi are really tender and even with a slight char from the grill, they never got overcooked.
565	1	BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS! This place is seriously amazing. It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though. They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy. It's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake.
800	0	On our recent trip to Vegas, my mother and I came here because of a rave review by some people we met on the trip. My mom wanted Chinese and I wanted Mexican, so the restaurant seemed perfect.  The prices were shocking ($5 per taco? seriously?) so we ended up sharing the chips & salsa, Mongolian beef, and 20 vegetable fried rice. The food was delicious, but the prices are outrageous. It was $32 for the beef (which was basically a glorified salad). It was a delicious strip steak, but tiny, we were expecting more. The fried rice was delicious but not worth $20. Plus, the amount of food we were given did not satisfy us. When we arrived my mother was starving, and she left unsatisfied so we ended up having a second (tiny) dinner at Serendipity 3. Next time I want Mexican in Vegas, I'll go to Yolos in Planet Hollywood.
1565	1	Chef's burger?  Delicious. Sweet potato fries with cinnamon honey something?  Sweet 'n tasty. Deep fried mac & cheese?  The undergrad in me was drooling. Hazelnut nutella milkshake?  I will take 8 lactaids because you cannot keep me away from it!  I haven't had a milkshake in ages (stupid lactose intolerance).  But this was worth popping one of those chalky white pills every few sips.  I am looking up the address in San Francisco because I am not waiting until the next time I'm in Vegas for the sweet or savory goodness that is Burger Bar.  I hear there's one in St. Louis too.  (Oh, and I have a little crush on Hubert Keller.  Shhhh - don't tell.)
744	1	One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life. Burger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious. The Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!  Highly, highly recommended.
1631	0	first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate.   i must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...  second time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well.   third time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how "eh" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small.   service was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?  maybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?
735	0	If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs.
1050	1	If you come to Vegas, you gotta come to this place for brunch after a long night out on the town.  It is just so goddamn cool, it is ridiculous.  This is a restaurant that looks like a strip club on the inside.  Neon pink and blue lights everywhere and a lounge that makes you feel like you are in the heart of Dirty Vegas.  Fireside Lounge looks absolutely incredible.  I will be back!  I had a simple breakfast platter which was extremely filling and the portions were generous.  Having a separate cocktail waitress come around and offer you alcohol at 10 am was interesting too.  Not bad at all.  I will be making it back here on future Vegas adventures.  No doubt.
1163	0	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.
1288	0	Last time I went there were choices for the cotton candy martini's.. This time the rude bartender snapped at me and said NO, there isn't. My friend and I ordered a cotton candy martini regardless. He kept saying he was busy and would attend to our order soon. I told him to take his time and he snapped and said NO I WON'T... umm ok, I was just trying to be nice and not pressure the guy.   4 drinks and crappy service later, we paid and the bartender approached my friend when she paid and said "Sorry for the lousy service". Really? Admitting to the lousy service but not doing anything to improve it. Thumbs down. I'm seriously disappointed. I won't be returning. The Sugar factory's goblets made up for the bad service and not so great drinks.   I'm disappointed :(   OH and it was my birthday.

I only wanted to go to try the famous hot chocolate. It was good..Nothing amazing, honestly. I really think Dunkin's is comparable. Had to do it to say I did it!
275	0	Being in Miami there are a lot of hot dog places which load up your hotdog with tons of yummy goodness stuff (try the green or pineapple sauce).  So I am used to eating a loaded hot dog...if you can, try it with quail egg.  This place? Why go when you have amazing restaurants all around you.  I get that its a cheaper alternative to the $40 plates around you.  But there is a reason why the hot dog costs $8.  If you are going to go cheaper, maybe just hit up the McDonalds thats located on the same strip.  Its not that this place is terrible or anything.  Its just not great.  So why waste your money or your calories?  The staff is nice and the place feels clean so that is a plus.  You can sit outside and people watch.
1531	1	I was so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, and his name did not disappoint! Amazing, delicious, juicy and innovative shakes, appetizers and desserts. The star of the show are the amazing burgers!  Chanterelle mushroom burger - so delicious and exceeded my expectations! The meat was tender and juicy, and was topped with perfectly cooked chanterelle mushrooms and arugula. The bun was soft and melt in my mouth, just the way I like it.   Honey-pig bao buns - I loved the juicy pork belly and the crunchy cucumber, radish and cilantro. The honey-hoisin sauce was sweet and went perfectly to complete the experience of this amazing appetizer.  Truffle-Parmesan Fries - Delicious truffle and cheesy goodness on each fry. Served with a luscious truffle aioli. Huge portion, one order can definitely be split by two people.   The restaurant is located at a prime location in Planet Hollywood. The flames at the exterior of the entrance is phenomenal and hard to miss. The decor is awesome and futuristic with the cool lights and fun interactive menu at the entrance.  Service is friendly and prompt. We arrived right before the restaurant opened and fortunately were seated right away.   Make sure to get their early if you want to be seated soon. There are no reservations, and often a wait at this popular burger joint.    Overall I really enjoyed Gordon Ramsay BurGR! Food is delicious and the experience is fun. Definitely worth stopping in here for amazing burger goodness while in Vegas.
1439	1	Fantastic start finish!  At first walking in you don't know what to except. The hallway to get there is cold and well... HIDDEN. The menu is short and sweet. The only downfall is it doesn't list toppings. But that detail is so minor compared to the rest of the experience. They have made to order pizzas for you to choose from. Or you can order an entire pie. My group picked the white pizza, combo, sausage and banana pepper and I picked the pepperoni and mushroom slices.  We ordered our drinks. The boys picked some beers and us girls went with wine, which was $6 for a large plastic cup filled. We were thrilled! Nowhere ever gives you that much wine for $6.. Let alone in Vegas. Our pizza took about 5 min to come out. And every pizza looked and smelled delicious  but then eating it was even more amazing then what my first two senses were showing me.   After we finished our slices we went back for one more slice of the white pizza. IT WAS THAT AMAZING!  I will be back to Vegas in 2 weeks. And will be back her for sure!!
1226	1	Highly recommend getting there before they open at 5:30pm. We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.    The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient.   The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck.   The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?
1394	1	This isn't your usual Korean BBQ place, no all-you-can-eat here.  But the portions are generous, the staff is courteous, and happy hour just makes everything better!  We happened to arrive during their happy hour, and we were greeted promptly.  Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.  Then the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade.
194	0	First off, this hotel is GHETTO!!! I came here to enjoy a juicy burger and check out hot skanks, this was the wrong place to go. The parking structure is insane! its so tiny and awkwardly designed, you can barley drive your car through it! consider yourself lucky if you happen to find parking. The elevators from the parking structure to the hotel/casino were semi-working. I got inside the death trap and it began to shake aggressively, stopped for a few seconds them shook again and proceeded to the main floor. Once inside the casino, it was filled with old white men, JUST men! and a few 60 something year old cocktail waitress'. I got to the restaurant, and to my surprise ALL the Hooters girls looked like something out of the Hills Have Eyes! the only hot waitress i spotted was like 7 months pregnant!.....ew. We ordered our food, 10 min go by....20 min go by....30 MINUTES go by.....ummm where the fuck is my burger? i asked my server what happened to our order, and she says "oh, umm you have to wait, the food always takes a long time" (we ordered a burger and a salad, nothing more!) after 40 minutes, i told her to cancel our order and close our beer tab. She says "ok, BYE" didn't even call a manager over or anything. VERY unprofessional.
1849	0	I've been coming here for many years when planet Hollywood was the Aladdin... it was amazing... sadly no more... its slowly been going downhill... I came here tonight with family who are visiting from overseas.. very disappointing... it'll be a long time before I return
237	0	My best friend from high schools little sister turned 21 recently so we all headed to vegas to some fun.  They all booked rooms here based on the pool, so I went on hotwire and booked a room for my boyfriend and myself.  While hotwire is all about not telling you what the hotel is they give you a map and its pretty easy to tell which hotel you will be in.  So that was all pretty easy.  I called them and specifically asked for a smoke free room with a king bed.  That was all pretty easy and nice.  Our room was in the West Wing, which is pretty reviled on yelp and I understand why.  While nothing was super bad about our stay, some things made it not a place I would pay to stay in again: -the valet, there are like 5 entrances to the MGM by car, but only one of them takes you to the valet. WTF -the west wing hallways are seriously dark and kinda skeevy looking -no mini fridges in the room -horrible cable, they have like 7 channels and 5 of them not in english -security came and scolded my friend for leaving the door to her room open while we were in it -the rooms have absolutely no sound proofing at all. you can hear everything in the hallway and in the rooms next to you.   -$15 a day for wifi.   -no robes -i tried to move the side table closer to the bed and it was super sticky, since we had just gotten there, that was pretty gross  MGM is supposed to be nice, but they obviously put all the people who purchase rooms on the internet in lame rooms with absolutely no amenities.  If I were to ever stay here again I would have to make sure it would not be in one of these rooms.
197	1	Absolutely amazing! The place was busy but we were still seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all for our food. Our banana nut muffins were so fresh they were still warm. We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!
1698	1	Absolutely incredible. Came here on a Wednesday night with my husband and had a phenomenal experience. We got there 30 minutes before our reservation time but they had no issues seating us.  SERVICE: Amazing. Our waiter was so knowledgable and he was perfectly attentive -- not too scarce and not too annoying. The steak presentation is amazing. Love it.  FOOD: First is the bread. It might as well be an appetizer -- they have a lemon rosemary bread, some bread with bacon, a walnut bread, etc and it's such a unique selection that you can't help but eat them all. For appetizer we ordered the 1/2 Dozen Oysters and they were so fresh and delicious. For dinner I ordered the Kobe Filet, hubby ordered the Signature Beef Wellington with a side of Bone Marrow and Fingerling Potatoes. Every single bite of every single entree was amazing. I very rarely am able to finish an entree but I polished off my 8 oz Filet which was so wonderfully tender and seasoned perfectly. My husbands Beef Wellington was perfectly balanced with the meat and pastry and cooked a perfect medium rare. The Bone Marrow was melt-in-your-mouth with great flavor. The Fingerling Potatoes were so good and I loved that you could taste both the parmesan and the truffle! I only wish we had saved room for dessert!  Will definitely be back!!
1715	1	a must pit stop for true burger lovers! i heart the food here so much that i would marry the patty if i could. hands down the best because its reasonably priced, the burger dances in your mouth, and you leave with a huge smile. you can the reg burger for about $13 and if you hit the jackpot in vegas and want to splurge, go for the truffle burger, mmmm! my friends and i make sure we visit this spot each time we are in vegas.   for large groups, reservations are recommended. it's BUSY in there! just thinking of this place makes me hungry.
913	1	Seriously the best burgers I have ever eaten. My friends and I go to Vegas several times a year and we always go to Bachi Burger several times each trip. You have to try the Kalbi burger and the truffle fries. The sodas are great too. Don't hesitate to try something new because EVERYTHING is so good there.
1362	0	Okay. I am a huge buffet connoisseur. Right now I am sitting here just finishing my TI buffet .  Paid $19 for each for lunch.  Only thing I can say is stay away.  Prepared foods were dry, selections limited, no carving station, and desserts were minimalistic. I used to love Treasure Island, unfortunately I am so depressed on the quality of the whole hotel as a whole.
1165	0	Food tasted ok. Nothing special. The menu had maybe 10 items on it. Service was ok. Highlight was the lady making the balloon hats. She was amazing. Kids meals were almost $9 and nothing exciting. Atmosphere was dead. The Senor Frogs we've previously been to were amazing. This one sucked. Wouldn't recommend or go back.
1258	0	worst Brazilian food ive ever had!! majority of meat was dry, hard, flavor less and BURNT. not charred, but burnt!!! for the price of this place i expected better food. servers were polite, but some meat cutters/servers are rude and seemingly arrogant. I went here for a prebirthday celebration and it was definitely a disappointment. Only reason for 2 stars is the salmon because it was delicious
1112	1	Just a dinner here. Service is great - bunch of people run by our table. Food was good. Portions are not as big as in the Thai St Cafe. $11 a meal. Would've put 4 stars but it fascinates me how this place grew from a whole in the wall to such a big place. Is it all because of celebrities?
361	1	Great Pizza. Great concept. For a hotel that builds its brand off of opulence and grandiosity. Its good to know that the Cosmopolitan isn't without a sense of humor or irony.  To find the joint,  just go down the out of place white tile hallway with crappy florescent lighting, you'll arrive in a room the size of a shoebox serving some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory.   Great food, great concept. Well done Cosmopolitan. It looks like management has a few risk takers.
517	0	WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! This place got me hella sick!  A whole day in Vegas ruined!!!   Never eat the chili!!! Right after I ate the hotdog, my stomach was killing me.  I had the runs and I threw up. A whole night in Vegas spent lying in bed sick because of this.
178	1	We love burgers! Saw this restaurant on Triple D.   We came here twice when we were in Vegas and ordered the following:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (sweet flavor and good amount of chili cheese!) Kiki Burger (filled with umami flavor!) Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (just like the name and tasted great!)  If you love burgers, and want to eat something different, get away from the strip and drive to Bachi! You will not be disappointed!
